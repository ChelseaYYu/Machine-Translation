# Machine Translation Project
## Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree
Overview
This project involves building a deep neural network as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The pipeline will accept English text as input and return the corresponding French translation.

Introduction
In this notebook, sections ending with '(IMPLEMENTATION)' indicate that the following blocks of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Please read the instructions carefully!

You will:

Preprocess text by converting it to sequences of integers.
Create models to accept sequences of integers as input and return a probability distribution over possible translations.
Design and experiment with different neural network architectures.
Run the model on English text to predict French translations.
Setup
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed, including keras, tensorflow, numpy, and other dependencies. Load the helper functions and tests.
